    <h2>Welcome to the ashok traning</h2>
    <p>Ashoka, also known as Ashoka the Great, was the third ruler of the Maurya Dynasty and is often considered one of
        India's most remarkable and influential emperors.
    </p>
    <!-- <p>He ascended to the throne around 268 BCE and initially followed in the footsteps of his predecessors, expanding
        his empire through warfare and conquest. However, the bloody Kalinga War became a turning point in his life,
        profoundly affecting him due to the immense suffering and loss of life it caused.
    </p> -->
    <p>
        Deeply moved by the horrors of the war, Ashoka converted to Buddhism and embraced the principles of non-violence
        (ahimsa), compassion, and dharma (righteousness). He dedicated himself to the welfare of his people,
        implementing policies that promoted social justice, animal welfare, and environmental conservation. Ashoka is
        particularly noted for his efforts to spread Buddhism both within his empire and beyond its borders, sending
        missionaries to various regions including Sri Lanka, Central Asia, and Southeast Asia.
